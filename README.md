A repository filled with codewars challenges (katas). Currently at the top  40% of the global leaderboard, completing 1-3 challenges daily.

## How It's Made:
Tech used: Javascript

First thing to do every morning, helps my brain to 'wake' up.

## Optimizations
I consistently refactor and optimize my code, sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability.

## Lessons Learned:
Sometimes i might get stuck in some of these questions, but that's totally fine. The great thing about this platform is than i can find community solutions on the given challenge, take my time analyzing them and truly understand them and then solve it myself! So i am still keep learning!
